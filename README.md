# Summary

I provided an example of how to solve an unbalanced transportation problem using the least cost method in Python.
I explained how to write a function to calculate the total cost of a transportation plan, a function to find the lowest cost cell in the cost matrix, and
a main function to solve the transportation problem. I also explained how to use the Google Drive API to save the code to your Google Drive.

To use the code, you will need to:

1. Set up a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Drive API.
2. Create an API key and download the API client library for Python.
3. Replace the API key in the code with your own API key.
4. Modify the cost_matrix, supply, and demand variables to specify the transportation problem you want to solve.
5. Call the solve_unbalanced_transportation_problem function with the cost_matrix, supply, and demand as arguments.
6. If you want to save the code to your Google Drive, call the save_file_to_drive function with the desired file name and contents as arguments.
